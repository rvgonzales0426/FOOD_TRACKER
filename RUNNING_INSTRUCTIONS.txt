# How to Run the Food Tracker Django Project

## Run the development server locally

Open your terminal and run the following command in the project root directory:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

This will start the Django development server on the default address and port:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Open this URL in your web browser to access the running application.

## If deployed on Vercel

After deployment, your live app will be accessible at the URL provided by Vercel, for example:

https://your-vercel-project-url.vercel.app/


Replace `your-vercel-project-url` with your actual Vercel project domain.

## Notes

- To stop the local server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
- Make sure you have all dependencies installed and environment variables set before running.
